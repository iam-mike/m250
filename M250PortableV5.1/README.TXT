M250Portable v5.1 is a Windows software package based on the 3.1.7 standalone version of BlueJ here:

http://www.bluej.org/versions.html

It includes the OpenJDK 7u65. Additions have been made for the Open University module 
M250 Object-oriented Java programming. 

The zip file should be unzipped before use. You need to unzip to a standard directory path.  
UNC paths (ones that begin \\) are not supported. There is no installer to run after unzipping.


1. The M250 microworlds used in Units 1 and 2 are in separate folders
under Activities/Worlds

To start AmphibianWorlds, use the shortcut startAmphibWorlds.
To start AccountsWorld, use the shortcut startAccountsWorld.

2. To run BlueJ (used from Unit 3 onwards) use Bluej.exe under M250PortableV5.
*Do not use BlueJ.exe under the BlueJ folder!* If you use the latter, it will 
prompt you to select a JDK each time you run it.

3. The documentation for OU provided classes is available via BlueJ's Help menu,
under OU Class Library, but can also be accessed directly in the oudocs folder
by opening the file index.html in a browser.

4. The Java API documentation is available online via BlueJ's help menu, 
under Java Class Libraries, but is not available offline in this package, due to its size.
You can also access the documentation directly online, here
