This project contains two examples of composition. 

See the files painting.txt and lollipop.txt for some example test code that you
can run inside the OUWorkspace.

=========================================================================

1. The classes Painting and Artist are related to one another by composition: 
a A Painting has-an Artist.

2. The class Lollipop models an object composed of a Circle and a Rectangle, 
which represent the sweet part of the lollipop and the stick attached to it. 
There are a constructors provided to allow you to create lollipop objects 
with different sizes and colours.

A Lollipop can be moved around the Shapes World graphical display using its methods 
horiz() and vert(), which allow the user to specify an amount to move by. 

Lollipops also have a lick() method, which causes the sweet to shrink and the stick 
to acquire some of the colour of the sweet.

==========================================================================

Discussion of the examples in this project is in the supplement to Unit 4 
Section 8.2, titled "Composition Supplement". This document is available
via the module website.
