This folder contains the OU Class Library documentation.

This is done in bluej's (global) properties file, C:\BlueJ\lib\bluej.defs as follows:

bluej.help.items=ouInfo
bluej.help.ouInfo.url=file\:///C\:/BlueJ/lib/userlib/oudoc/index.html
bluej.help.ouInfo.label=OU Class Library

This assumes that the folder oudoc has been added to the userlib folder of the BlueJ installation.

Making these changes will provide a link to the OU Class Library documentation from Bluej's help menu.
