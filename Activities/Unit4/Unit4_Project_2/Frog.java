 * Objects of the Frog class are simple software representations of frogs.

 * The protocol provides messages to set the instance variables and to
 * cause changes in an appropriate user interface. Incrementing and
 * decrementing a frog's position by a whole number is reflected in an
 * appropriate user interface as spatial movement to the user's right and
 * left, respectively. (Hence the messages for incrementing and decrementing
 * position are called right() and left().)
